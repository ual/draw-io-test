# draw.io demo

To collaborate with other UAL lab members on technical diagrams, use [draw.io](https://www.draw.io). First, create a UAL GitHub repo. Then, tell draw.io save diagram to GitHub and point it to that repo. Your saves will be commits to the repo. Anyone else with UAL GitHub access can load that repo and edit the diagram similarly.
